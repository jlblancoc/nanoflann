nanoflann 1.1.5: (Under development, SVN version)
  * Fixed: Memory pool wasn't freed after each call to buildIndex()

nanoflann 1.1.4: Released Jan 11, 2013
  * Fixed compilation with Visual Studio 11 (MSVC 2012). 
  * Fixed compilation of gtest with VS11 and its _VARIADIC_MAX "bug".
  * Added a security check to launch an exception if searches are attempted before buildIndex().
  * New example to demonstrate save/load the index to files. 
  * save/load methods exposed as public.

nanoflann 1.1.3: Released Jun 6, 2012
  * GTest sources are now embedded, due to the changes in newer Ubuntu packages which don't carry the precompiled libs.
  * Added asserts to detect whether the user passes NULL as query points.
  * New method RadiusResultSet::worst_item()
  * New method RadiusResultSet::set_radius_and_clear()
  * Avoid potential collision of min/max macros with <windows.h>
  * Removed unneeded #include's of std headers. 
  * New sample code for vectors of vectors.
  * Fixed building of tests for MSVC in Windows.
  * Allow manually setting the path to Eigen3 (mainly for building examples under Windows).

nanoflann 1.1.2: Released May 2, 2012
  * Better documentation and added graphs of a benchmarking for helping choosing "leaf_max_size".
  * Now KDTreeSingleIndexAdaptor::buildIndex() can be called several times 
     even when the dataset size changes (Thanks to Rob McDonald for reporting!)

nanoflann 1.1.1: Released Feb 1, 2012
  * Some fixes to kd_tree index and L1/L2 metrics to allow distinct types 
     in data elements and in the distances. This is mainly to permit elements 
	 being vectors of integers (e.g. uint8_t) but distances being real numbers.
  * Examples and unit tests have been corrected to use template arguments 
     instead of being hard-wired to "float" data types (Thanks Thomas Vincent 
	 for noticing!).

nanoflann 1.1.0: Released Dec 15, 2011
  * Fixed warnings for MSVC and for GCC with "-Wall -pedantic"
  * Updated performance tests to work with the final nanoflann code (they were 
     written for a very early version).
  * All main classes now have new template arguments for the type of indice, 
     which now defaults to "size_t" instead of "int". In case this breaks 
     backward compatibility in user code, especify "int" to override the default 
     template arguments, although "size_t" it's recommended.

nanoflann 1.0.0: Released Aug 30, 2011
  * Initial version
